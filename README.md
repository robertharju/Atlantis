A different way of thinking. Atlantis Protocol is to move beyong the current, while allowing future, speed at which Bitcoin transactions are handeled.

Atlantis Protocol (further noted as "AP") is not to replace Bitcoin or Lightning. AP is a layer that can be injected and run atop any pre-existing system.

AP can process and write at quicker rates, by utilizing technology that has existed for many generations, allowing it to write to current layers on a mass scale.
